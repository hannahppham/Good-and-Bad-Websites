			<h2><font face="orator std">The Flavr Blue</font></h2>
				<p><img src="the flavr blue web.png" title="The Flavr Blue"></p>
				<p><font face="orator std" size="2" color="black"><a href="http://theflavrblue.com">See website here</a></font></p>
				<p><font face="helvetica" size="2">The Flavr Blue is a group based in Seattle.  Their musical style would be considered as electronic, r&b, and alternative. 
				One of the three members named, Hollis, received a lot of recognition after her feature in Macklemore's song <i>White Walls</i>. 
				In addition to that their  activeness in the community of the Pacific Northwest has gained them more traffic. 
				To supplement their upcoming fame, their website displays information and reflects their music style in a successful manner.
				They achieve this without using too much text which can result in confusion for users who use the website.
				A few images help add aesthetics and portray more information about the group in an abstract way. It is well organized and links are functional.</font></p>
			<h2><font face="orator std">Cornish Compass</font></h2>
				<p><img src="cornish web.png" title="Cornish Compass"></p>
				<p><font face="orator std" size="2" color="black"><a href="http://compass.cornish.edu">See website here</a></font></p>
				<p><font face="helvetica" size="2">The Cornish Compass website is ironically a somewhat bad website (not the worst but has poorly developed elements).
				The website is a very cluttered with information, which since it is a school website it can be justified but as a website on its own,
				the links do not function as efficiently as they can. The website doesn't allow the back-button to function and instead reloads the page or redirects it.</font></p>
